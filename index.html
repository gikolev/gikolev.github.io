<p>I’m a Procurement and Transformation leader with 15 years of experience building and scaling procurement functions from the ground up and delivering value in high-growth, fast-paced companies.  In my current role of Director of Procurement and Real Estate at <a target="_blank" href="https://simplisafe.com">SimpliSafe</a>, I lead a team responsible for partnering with business unit leaders on strategic sourcing initiatives.  Earlier, I was at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.clarksusa.com">Clarks</a> where I held several positions in procurement, project management, and forecasting. Prior to Clarks, I was at Vox, a boutique procurement consulting firm based in Cambridge, MA.</p>

<p>I recently graudated with an MBA from Boston University, where I was suprised to learn that I enjoyed predicting future cash flows and ended up concentrating in Finance.  I hold the CPSM certification from the Institute for Supply Management, and my interest in data science led me to the ten-course Data Science specialization offered by the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health through Coursera.</p>

<p>My current professional interests include leveraging AI to enable better decisions, strategy and financial forecasting.  In my spare time you can find me <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/george_kolev">reading</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NmIALIqy0Wg16BvOq91yU2UTT92eD5C2&usp=sharing">traveling</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://vsco.co/giklv/images">taking photos</a>, or cycling.</p>
