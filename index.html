<p>I am passionate about project management and process optimization.  In my current role as a Manager of Strategic Projects at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.clarksusa.com">Clarks</a> I am responsible for developing, owning, and delivering key projects on our strategic roadmap.  I am currently a US Project Lead for the Foundation Program, a 3-year strategic investment targeting improvements in how Clarks plans, buys, moves and sells stock accross all of our channels and regions, through the implementation of new systems by JDA and SAP. In addition, I am acting as a global Product Owner for the agile implementation of JDA Demand and Fulfilment.  Earlier, I managed indirect procurement projects in the US, Canada and Latin America as a Procurement Analyst. Prior to Clarks, I was at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.voxsupplychain.com">Vox</a>, a supply chain startup based in Cambridge, MA.</p>

<p>I recently completed the CPSM certification from the Institute for Supply Management, and the ten-course Data Science specialization offered by the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health through Coursera. Some of my R coursework is on <a target="_blank" href="https://rpubs.com/gikolev">RPubs</a></p>

<p>My current professional interests include agile project management, end-to-end supply chain planning and optmization, and data visualizatoin and analytics.
